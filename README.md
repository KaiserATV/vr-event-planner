# Gluehwein-planer
A simple tool that allows the planning, simulation and saving of structrures placed in an city-enviroment.

# Features
The Tool allows the placing of structures, as well as removing them. You can toggle a Simulation in which the movement 
of customers is simulated. You can move, remove and add structures as you like. 
It is possible to toggle a Heatmap, in which visualizes the utilization of a cell in different states.
The navigation of the scene is possible in two ways, either through teleporation or in the so called godmode.



# Current State
Currently the tool only allows the simulating of events in the centre of Leipzig. 
Also only 1 model for an structure, a point to which agents seek, is in use. 
Also the number of agents in the scene are limited to about 1800 agents due to the Navmesh plugin.
